# LUA SOCKET for Quik
Must have stuff to use LUA SOCKET with Quik

Quik is a standard trading terminal (developed by Arqatech) that is provided by many Russian brokers for direct market access in Russia. Mainly it is used to trade on MOEX. Many info is avaliable on official site - https://arqatech.com/ru/

Starting from Quik terminal v8.5 LUA v 5.3 is supported.

Many Quik users use LUA in different ways by personally I prefer to export data from Quik using Sockets. To support sockets for Quik LUA several files and DLLs are necessary. All can be found in this repo.
All folders and files should be copied into QUIK parent folder/
